== Description ==

> In a nutshell: Finally be able to duplicate and edit live posts without messing up the actual live version.

This plugin gives users the ability to clone, edit, and then merge back the updated copy back into the original post.

You control who has access to duplicate, you also control who has the permissions to merge the newly cloned edited post back into the original.

** Here's the flow: **

Orignal Post -> Clone -> Edit -> Merge back to Original Post
